4. Alabama and BBHera22 have their dates in wrong format for first recorded, "2022-10-31" and "2023-01-18" respectively

9. "Goose" has a duplicated entry, I deleted the one that had FirstDate == "2021-05-25" and Included CrazyEyes to the other one
10. "Zanzibar" has a duplicated entry, I deleted the one that did not had DOB
11. Individual  "Baby Pann 2017" to "Baby Pannekoekie 2017" to be consistent
12. "Yelowstone" to "Yellowstone", to spell it correct
13. "Baby Kodiak 2020" birthgroup is "CR"

15. Miguel corrected "Halfy" LastSeen1 to "2015-07-09"
16. This animals: "Delux","Nora", "Gangtok" Have Na instead of NA in ImmigrationGroup1.
17. From comments. LastDate2 for Kommunis is wrong. 2021 instead 2022. Good LastDate2 == "2021-12-14"
18. Lif date of brain extraction: "2022-08-15", But the end date in NH is 2022-09-12. One of those two are wrong.
19. wes and pun cannot have a DOB if they don+t have a BirthGroup
20. Mention in comments, in which age state the females and males of IF were. For individuals, Athe. Circ, Frey, Hera, Medu, Pand and Pers. For example: Medu was an adult when first seen. Or pers was a juvenile when first seen
21. Ryan and Japan have a later FirstSeen than ImmigrationDate1
22.




Issues not sent yet:
1. Goose has two entries and are a bit of a mess.
2. Apa leaving date from LT should be changed. Apa was seen in LT an encounter with BD the 2022-7-26. So I suggest the
LastSeen1 to be 2022-7-26, instead of 2022-7-25.



I have sent This to nokubonga 28/mar/2023 working on an older file:
- Liffey has no end date for his time in Noha. Brain was extracted in: 20.08.2022, I will approximate to 5 days before as approx of End_Date in NH.
- Liffey date as an adult, he migrated as an adult Individualâ€™s Age (state if estimated): at least 7 years, but already seen as an adult. So probably 11 years
or more.
- No ages for IFam for adulthood
- "Babyrenn2020" inconsistent between DOB and First seen
- Kom LastDate2 should be 2021-12-14 instead of 2022-12-14
- Change LastDate1 date for Inhl, the last seen date was done for when we were not following IFam anymore, but now that we do we should remove those "last obs".
-  Ass End Date is wrong. He is described in the bges of 2022-06-07 and 2022-12-08 between
- Apa, by the description of BGE seems like the start date in BD is wrong. He was described to have bge 3 days before the start day in BD. Apa described as active individual in an ecounter happening the 2022-07-26. And his start date is the 2022-07-27.
- I don't have the entries of the following monkeys: Dak (from NH), Haw (from CR), Kno (from BD), NewMale090622 (from CR), Pand (from IF) and PlainJohn (which I am not sure if is a type of PlainJane


--------
# things Nokubonga can+t do anything about
- Ass Bon Dan Gaa Med Pit Sel SMA Uva Yst have no emigrationNatalDate or ImmigrationDate1 but they changed group.... I guess we would need to check the first entries of these individuals in the database.
