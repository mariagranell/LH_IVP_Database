- Liffey has no end date for his time in Noha. Brain was extracted in: 20.08.2022, I will approximate to 5 days before as approx of End_Date in NH.
- Liffey date as an adult, he migrated as an adult Individualâ€™s Age (state if estimated): at least 7 years, but already seen as an adult. So probably 11 years
or more.
- No ages for IFam for adulthood
- "Babyrenn2020" inconsistent between DOB and First seen
- Kom LastDate2 should be 2021-12-14 instead of 2022-12-14
- Change LastDate1 date for Inhl, the last seen date was done for when we were not following IFam anymore, but now that we do we should remove those "last obs".
-  Ass End Date is wrong. He is described in the bges of 2022-06-07 and 2022-12-08 between
- Apa, by the description of BGE seems like the start date in BD is wrong. He was described to have bge 3 days before the start day in BD. Apa described as active individual in an ecounter happening the 2022-07-26. And his start date is the 2022-07-27.
